Email Structure

1. Subject Line
Start with a strong subject that combines the candidate's background, fit, and the specific role.
Format: [Specific Impact Area] PM with [X years / key credential] — [Role Title] at [Company]
Example: Enterprise Platform PM with $100M Revenue Impact — Principal PM, Monetization at Stripe

2. First Paragraph — Why Join
- Open with "Dear [Reach Out Person Name],"
- Mission alignment and personal why — tie the candidate's values to the company's mission.
- Position the role as the natural next step based on what the candidate has done and wants to keep doing.
- Keep factual, concise, and avoid repeating bullet metrics.
- Rule: No fluff. No duplication from bullets. Demonstrate genuine interest.

3. Second Paragraph — Why I Am a Fit
- Frame as: "I am a strong fit for this role because at [company] I..."
- Map the candidate's past experience to the role's top 3 needs from the job description.
- Use 3 bullets maximum.
- Each bullet = scope and measurable impact, directly mapped to a role requirement.
- Pull evidence from the candidate's resume provided.

4. Closing Paragraph
- Explicitly state how the candidate's expertise will help solve the company's specific challenges in this role.
- Avoid generic "vision and execution" closes.
- If the email is addressed to a hiring manager or director: close with "Happy to start with your recruiter partner — feel free to add them to this email or forward it along."
- If the email is addressed to a recruiter: close by asking for next steps directly.

5. Signature
<YOUR_FULL_NAME>
<YOUR_EMAIL> | <YOUR_PHONE>
<YOUR_LINKEDIN_URL>
Resume attached.

Writing Rules
- Mirror the company's own language and phrasing from the job description exactly (e.g. "monetization," "platform infrastructure," "GTM systems").
- Keep tone confident, concise, and impact-driven.
- No fluff. No duplication between paragraphs. No generic claims.
- Use "and" instead of "&" everywhere except official company names.
- No em-dashes. Use commas to connect clauses.
- Total email body: 200 to 250 words maximum. Count carefully.

Output Format
Return only the email. No explanation, no preamble, no markdown formatting.
